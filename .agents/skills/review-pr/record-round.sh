# Deviation (spec 0003): the body file must carry `Author:`, `Reviewers:` and `Checked:` lines, and a `pass` is refused when
# the author is among the reviewers: a review that the author records about its own PR is not independent. Names are
# self-declared, so this stops the honest mistake, not a forgery.
# record-round.sh <pr> <round> <pass|changes> <body-file>
# Posts one review round on the PR as a GitHub review (comment), headed by the marker that merge.sh requires.
# The head is read from GitHub, so a record always names the commit that was reviewed.
